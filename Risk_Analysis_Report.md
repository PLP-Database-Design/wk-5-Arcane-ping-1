## Risk Coverage Analysis

**Coverage Calculation:**
- Total Risks: 8
- Tested Risks: 7 (R-01 through R-06, R-08)
- Tested Percentage: (7/8) √ó 100 = **87.5%**

**Priority Coverage:**
- CRITICAL: 100% (1/1) ‚úÖ
- HIGH: 100% (3/3) ‚úÖ
- MEDIUM: 100% (2/2) ‚úÖ
- LOW: 50% (1/2) ‚úì

## Test Coverage Mapping

| Risk ID | Test Case IDs | Test Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| R-01 | TC-03 | PASS |
| R-02 | TC-02, TC-08 | FAIL - Critical defect found |
| R-03 | TC-02, TC-04 | Mixed results |
| R-04 | TC-01, TC-05, TC-07, TC-09 | FAIL - UX defect found |
| R-05 | TC-05 | PASS |
| R-06 | TC-06 | PASS |
| R-08 | TC-10 | PASS |

## Defect Correlation

| Defect ID | Risk ID | Issue | Severity |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| D-01 | R-02 | Leaderboard data persistence failure | High |
| D-02 | R-03 | Leaderboard saves intermediate scores | Medium |
| D-03 | R-04 | No confirmation before resetting | Medium |

## Key Findings

1. **Highest Impact Risk Confirmed:** R-02 (data persistence) validated as critical defect
2. **100% High Priority Coverage:** All critical/high risks thoroughly tested
3. **Strategic Omission:** R-07 excluded due to low priority/time constraints
4. **Risk-Based Testing Success:** Methodology effectively identified real defects

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix:** Address R-02 (data persistence) - critical functionality
2. **UX Improvement:** Address R-04 (reset confirmation) - user experience
3. **Future Testing:** Consider testing R-07 in next cycle if time permits
